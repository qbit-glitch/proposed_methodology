## What is MLP in ViT ?

In the context of Vision Transformers (ViT), MLP stands for Multi-Layer Perceptron. It refers to a two-layer classification network that typically uses the GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) activation function and is often called the MLP head, which serves as the output layer of the transformer for tasks like image classification. The MLP processes the output from the transformer encoder, applying transformations to prepare the data for final predictions.
